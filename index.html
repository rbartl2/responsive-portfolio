            <p>Greetings and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Rebecca Bartl, and I am very excited to begin this technological journey. Coding is a brand new venture for me, as I have been bartending for the past decade. With all the hype surrounding women in tech, I jumped at the opportunity to devolop new skills and make a career change.</p>
            <p>Originally from New York, I have settled in Nashville after spending lots of time living in Boston and Australia. I have develped a love for vintage wine throughout my years of bartending, an '89 Bordeaux being my favorite varietal! Waking up with a latte and taking my chocolate lab, Kingsley, on a long walk is one of my favorite daily activities.</p>
            <p>I'm excited to dive into this new knowledge and begin my journey!</p>
